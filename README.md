# About
Bulk-import from [Cash App](https://cash.app/) to [EveryDollar](https://www.everydollar.com/app/budget). 

I created this, because there is no official way to do it, and I was tired of doing it manually. 

(P.S. Hire me Dave Ramsey -- I'll add this functionality directly to EveryDollar.)

# Donate
I created this for free. If it helps you out, send me a few bucks (I KNOW you have Cash App ðŸ˜›)
